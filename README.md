# Ultra File Compress AIO
7-Zip-based batch files for efficient ultra file compression. No separate 7-Zip installation is needed, as batch files 
already include required components (7z.exe and 7z.dll).

# Highlights:
1. Use in terminals (CMD, PowerShell) or via drag-and-drop.
2. Choose from 6 variants with varying speed-compression ratios,
   - From Compress_Very_Low.cmd (faster, slightly lower ratio).
   - To Compress_Extreme.cmd (slower, significantly higher ratio).
3. Compressed files remain in the original's location.
4. All file types are supported, directories too.

# Usage:
1. Terminals (CMD, PowerShell):
   - Open terminal.
   - Navigate to batch file's directory.
   - Execute: `Compress_.cmd "path\to\file"`
2. Drag and Drop:
   - Locate file.
   - Drag onto preferred Compress_.cmd file.

# More info:
1. Obviously: if you want, you can rename the Compress_.cmd file.
2. Obviously: the the Compress_.cmd file has to have .cmd or .bat extension.
3. Obviously: the files are compressed to .7z archieves.
